<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview
benchmarKIN provides two complementary benchmarking approaches to evaluate 
kinase activity inference tools. This has already been applied to a number
of computational algorithms and prior knowledge resources [here](https://github.com/saezlab/kinase_benchmark).

To run the benchmarking approaches yourself please check out the [documentation](https://benchmarkin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).
