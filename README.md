<!-- badges: start -->

## Overview
benchmarkeR provides two complementary benchmarking approaches to evaluate 
kinase activity inference tools. This has already been applied to a number
of computational algorithms and prior knowledge resources [here](https://github.com/saezlab/kinase_benchmark).

To run the benchmarking approaches yourself please follow these tutorials:

- [Perturbation based benchmark](https://github.com/saezlab/benchmarkeR/blob/main/vignettes/perturbBench.Rmd)
- [CPTAC based benchmark](https://github.com/saezlab/benchmarkeR/blob/main/vignettes/cptacBench.Rmd)
